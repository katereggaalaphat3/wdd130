            <h2>Introduction to the Holy Grail Layout</h2>
            <p>The Holy Grail layout is a common web page layout that includes a header, footer, main content area, and sidebars. It is called the "Holy Grail" because it has been a coveted layout for web designers, providing a solid structure that is easy to understand and navigate. This layout demonstrates the use of semantic HTML elements, which help in creating well-structured and accessible web pages.</p>

            <h2>Benefits of Semantic HTML</h2>
            <p>Semantic HTML elements enhance the accessibility, readability, and SEO of a web page. They provide meaningful context to the content, allowing browsers and assistive technologies to better understand the structure and importance of different parts of the page. This improves the user experience for people with disabilities and helps search engines to index the content more accurately, resulting in better search rankings.</p>
